# How to contribute?

Welcome! ðŸŽ‰ You can see the things [to do](TODO.md) or the open issues [here](https://github.com/anapaulagomes/looong/issues).

## Steps

Steps to contribute:

1. Look for a issue or open a new one [here](https://github.com/anapaulagomes/looong/issues)
2. Create a new branch with an intuitive name (thinking about the concept of [feature branch](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html)
3. Do amazing stuff and have fun
4. Run tests
5. If they are passing, you are free to commit and push
6. Open a Pull Request with a description and the issue reference

Test-Driven Development is awesome to thinking about the design first and keep things simples. We recommend it.

## Best Pratices

Let's try to keep the code as simple and clean as we can. Some good pratices to follow during the contributing process:

- **Respect the PEP8**: don't forget to check the PEP8 complains; you can use pre-commit hook to help you with
- **Write Tests**: **always** write tests for your code
- **Use Feature Branch**: if you are fixing a bug, please add `hotfix/branch-name` to your branch name; if is a feature, add `feature/branch-name`
- **Keep the Cordiality**: be polite and kind; words like please and thank you are welcome :)

We recommend to use virtual environments like [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/).
